## import data
```{r}
brfss21_data = read_csv("./data/cleaned_brfss21.csv") %>%
  mutate(mh_cat3 = factor(mh_cat3, levels = c("none", "<=15 days", ">15 days")),
         mh_bin = factor(mh_bin, levels = c("<=15 days", ">15 days")),
         depression = factor(depression, levels = c("no", "yes")),
         sex = factor(sex, levels = c("male", "female")),
         children = factor(children, levels = c("none", "one or two", "three or more")),
         state = factor(state),
         race = factor(race, levels = c("white", "black", "asian", "hispanic", "other")),
         education = factor(education, levels = c("less than high school", "high school or some college", "bachelors or higher")),
         income = factor(income, levels = c("<=35000", "35000-75000", ">75000")),
         employment = factor(employment, levels = c("employed", "homemaker/student/retired", "unemployed")),
         age = factor(age, levels = c("18-29", "30-49", "50-64", "65+")),

         exercise = factor(exercise, levels = c("yes", "no")))
head(brfss21_data)
```

Next, create a survey design object for incorporating sample weights.
```{r}
# Set options for allowing a single observation per stratum 
options(survey.lonely.psu = "adjust")

# Create survey design 
brfss_design = as_survey_design(brfss21_data, id = 1, strata = ststr, weight = llcpwt)

```

## State-level age-Adjusted prevalence of depression by gender
```{r}
brfss_design %>%
  group_by(state, sex, depression) %>%
  summarize(depression_prev = survey_mean(na.rm = T, vartype = c("ci")))
```
