<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Current literature provide inconsistent evidence on gender difference
in mental health outcomes. According to WHO, “women are more likely to
be treated for depression than men even though the rates of depression
don’t differ greatly between the gender”. However, there are also
research studies suggesting that women are more likely than men to have
depression. To solve this confusion, the main goals of this project are
to 1) compare state-level differences in depression prevalence and
average number of days with unwell mental health between US adult men
and women and 2) examine factors that potentially affect mental health
outcomes. After finding out whether there indeed is a gender gap in
mental health outcomes, it may in turn supply evidence that help answer
other public health questions, such as whether women are overtreated for
mental health disorders.</p>
</div>
<div id="background-and-related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Background and related work</h2>
<p>As Leibenluft, E mentioned in his book <em>Gender differences in mood
and anxiety disorders: From bench to bedside.</em>, whether the
presentation and course of illness differ by gender remain unknown
because of different researches give different results. And based on the
large amount of data given by CDC (<em>Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System Survey Data</em>), we believe we can answer this
question by means of data analysis. At the same time, ignoring these
differences (as it always has been) may cause danger to patients, stated
by Partner, Q in <em>Exploring gender bias in healthcare</em>. For men,
they are less likely to be treated partially because they resist
discussing their emotion with doctor due to gender stereotype. For
women, we also need to guarantee that they won’t be overtreated. These
related works show the importance of finding out the main effects for
depression of different genders. Also, noticing that the United States
is a country with great diversity among different states, we decided to
explore the circumstances at state-level.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are interested in how presence of children in the
household might affect women and men’s mental health differently. This
question was inspired by personal observations and experience - Women
are usually more likely to assume more care-giving responsibilities in
the household. Then is women’s mental health affected more than men’s by
the presence of children in the household?</p>
</div>
<div id="research-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Research questions</h2>
<div id="main-research-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Main research questions</h3>
<p>We are interested in the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How does the geological distribution of mental health outcomes
across US states differ among men and women?</p></li>
<li><p>Do men and women have different mental health outcomes, taking
into account of demographic, socioeconomic, and health factors?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the number of children in the household affect the mental
health of men and women differently?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="post-hoc-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Post-hoc questions</h3>
<p>While answering our main research questions, some additional
interesting questions emerged, and we tried answering some of them after
our main analyses. These “post-hoc” questions include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is state-level prevalence of mental health outcomes associated with
state-level gender inequality?<br />
</li>
<li>How do mental health care service utilization and opinions on mental
health disorders differ among men and women? How are these differences
associated with women and men’s mental health?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="method" class="section level2">
<h2>Method</h2>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>We uses multiple data sources for our project. For our main research
questions, we used the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) data downloaded from <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html">the CDC
website</a>. BRFSS is an annual, nationally representative
cross-sectional survey on non-institutionalized American adults’
health-related risk behaviors, health conditions, and health care
seeking behaviors. The BRFSS is a complex survey that involves
multistage clustering and stratification. In 2021, 438,693 Americans
were included in the BRFSS.</p>
<p>For our post-hoc explorations, we used the Women, Peace, and Security
(WPI) index published by Georgetown University. According to the <a
href="https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/">organization’s
website</a>, the WPS index draws from recognized data source to quantify
women’s inclusion, justice, and security. We used this index as a
measurement of state-level gender inequality. We also downloaded the US
states’ GDP per capita in 2021 from <a
href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/248063/per-capita-us-real-gross-domestic-product-gdp-by-state/">here</a>.
We also used the 2012 BRFSS data, which is the last (most recent) BRFSS
survey that contains questions on mental health service utilization and
questions related to attitudes and beliefs toward mental health care and
stigmatization. This data set was also downloaded from <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2012.html">the CDC
website</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="outcome-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Outcome variables</h3>
<p>We used two variables to measure mental health. The first variable is
the self-reportd past depression. The participants were asked if they
have ever been told that they had a depressive disorder (including
depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression). The
second variable is the self-reported number of days of bad mental health
in the past 30 days. The participants were asked: “Now thinking about
your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with
emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental
health not good?”.</p>
<p>For the first outcome variable, we dichotomized it into a binary
variable with two levels: “yes” and “no”. For the second outcome
variable, we recoded it into a binary variable with two levels: <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> 15 days mental health not good in
the past 30 days, and more than 15 days mental health not good in the
past 30 days.</p>
<p>We used the first outcome variable as a proxy to measure respondents’
chronic mental health status, since it asks for any occurrence of
depression, a common mental health disorder, across the respondent’s
life span. We used the second outcome variable as a proxy for measuring
respondents’ temporal mental health status, since it asks about recent
mental health status.</p>
</div>
<div id="exposures" class="section level3">
<h3>Exposures</h3>
<p>We are interested in two exposure variables. The first one is
respondent’s gender coded as female or male based on their answers to
whether they were male or female and whether they were male or female at
birth. The second exposure variable is the number of children in the
respondent’s household, which was recoded to three levels: none, one or
two, and three or more.</p>
</div>
<div id="covariates" class="section level3">
<h3>Covariates</h3>
<p>Demographic covariates in our analyses include race/ethnicity
(recoded as non-Hispanic white, black, Asian, Hispanic, and other), age
(recoded as 18-29 years old, 30-49 years old, 50-64 years old, and 65 or
older), employment status (recoded as employed for salary,
homemake/student/retired, and unemployed), and marital status (recoded
as married and not married). Socioeconomic cavariates include education
level (recoded as less than high school, high school or some college,
and Bachelors’s degree or higher) and annual income (recoded as <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> 35000 dollars, between 35000 and
75000 dollars, and more than 75000 dollars). Health-related covariates
include self-reported general health (recoded as excellent, very
good/good, and fair/poor) and any self-reported exercises in the past 30
days (recoded as yes and no).</p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
<p>National surveys such and BRFSS and NHIS are not simple random
samples because observations have different probabilities of being
sampled due to complex survey designs. Therefore, before analyzing
nationally representative survey data, we must apply survey weights, or
all our estimates will be invalid. In our project, after selecting,
cleaning, and recoding the variables, we converted the data set into a
survey design object using the srvyr package.</p>
<p>We computed weighted and unweighted summary counts of exposure and
covariate categories in each level of the two mental health outcome
variables. We used Chi-squared tests for weighted survey data to
identify differences in mental health outcomes by gender as well as
differences in mental health outcomes and other variables (e.g., number
of children in household, age, race/ethnicity) by gender.</p>
<p>We used binary logistic regression to examine the association between
gender and past depression and &gt;15 days mental health not good in the
past 30 days, respectively. We started with a crude model that only
included the exposures (gender and the number of children in the
household). Then we constructed a larger model by adding demographic
covariates, which are age, race/ethnicity, and marital status. Then we
constructed another model by adding socioeconomic covariates to the
previous model, which are education, annual income, and employment
status. Finally, we constructed our full model by adding physical health
related variables, which are self-reported general health and
self-reported any physical exercise in the past 30 days. Survey weights
were applied to all regression models as well. The regression models
were compared using the AIC criterion. Models with the lowest AIC values
were selected as final models.</p>
<p>The final model for each of the two mental health outcomes were used
to compute the predictive marginal means for each independent variable.
According to the documentation of the survey package, the predictive
marginal mean for one level of a factor variable is the
probability-weighted average of the fitted values for the model on new
data where all observations are set to that specific level of the factor
variable but have whatever values of adjustment covariates they really
have. In our case where we have a binary logistic regression model, the
predictive marginal mean shows the effect of a categorical variable on
the predicted probability of the response variable, adjusting for all
other predictor variables included in the model. We computed the
predictive marginal means because we think it better demonstrates the
magnitude of a factor predictor’s effect on the outcome variable than
the odds, because odds are less intuitive than probabilities. The final
models were also used to calculate the predicted probability of each
mental health outcome given each combination of levels of independent
variables. We put these results in a Shiny app so that users can play
around with different factor levels and observe how they affect mental
health outcomes according to our selected model.</p>
<p>To check whether the number of children in the household has
differential effect on mental health by gender, we subsetted the data by
gender (one data set only has men, the other only has women) and ran the
best logistic regression models selected from above separately on the
two subsetted data sets, excluding the gender variable.</p>

class="section level4">
<h4>Respondent-level Analysis: Recent frequency of bad mental
health</h4>
<p>In our exploratory analysis for the outcome variable, the
self-reported number of days of bad mental health in the past 30 days,
we first examined whether it is associated with the exposure,
respondent’s gender using a chi-square test. The resulting p-value of
1.014e-67 indicates that <strong>the number of days of bad mental health
in the past 30 days is associated with gender in that more % of women
reported &gt;15 days of bad mental health in the past month</strong>. We
then proceeded to studying the relationship between the number of days
of bad mental health in the past 30 days and other covariates, on top of
the effects of gender.<br />
We first studied how the number of children in the household affected
the self-reported prevalence of over 15 days of bad mental health in the
past 30 days among men and women. Based on a bar plot, we found an
interesting result that men who have children in the household have a
significantly lower prevalence of self-reported over 15 days of bad
mental health while women who have children don’t, which was verified by
chi-square tests with p-values of 0.023 and 0.093 for men and women,
respectively. That is, the number of children in the household is
significantly associated with self-reported over 15 days of bad mental
health in the past 30 days among men but not women.</p>
<p>Next, we created a bar plot to examine how gender and race together
associate with the self-reported prevalence of over 15 days of bad
mental health in the past 30 days. The result is that the prevalence of
reported more than 15 days of in the past 30 days being in bad mental
health is higher in women than men for all included ethnicities (White,
Black, Asian, Hispanic, and others). More specifically, White women have
the highest prevalence of bad mental health among Black, Asian, and
Hispanic women, and the same holds true for Black Men. Another
covariate, age, was also studied with gender together for the effects on
the prevalence of more than 15 days of being in bad mental health.
Through the barplot generated, we found that for women, the prevalence
of self-reported over 15 days of bad mental in the past 30 days drops
slightly when entering the age group of 50-64, but decreases noticeably
when entering the age group of 30-49 and of 65+ (the same trend is
displayed among men but in smaller magnitude). This result was supported
by the confidence interval plot below (the gap in the magnitude of
change in prevalence of a self-reported number of days in bad mental
health in the past 30 days might be an indication of aging affecting
self-reported bad mental health days differently for men and women).</p>
<p>We then took a closer look at the outcome variable of self-reported
past depression. Similarly, for starters, we examined if it is
associated with gender by the chi-square test. The small p-value (0)
indicates that the prevalence of self-reported past depressions is
dependent on gender. Then, we tested the effects of the number of
children in households on past depression based on gender through a
barplot. An interesting observation is that similar to the self-reported
number of days of bad mental health in the past 30 days, the prevalence
of depression is also significantly lower in men who have children in
the family than in women who have children. The p-value of 0.663 and
3.49e-12 from the chi-square test demonstrate that self-reported past
depression is indeed significantly associated with the number of
children in the household among men instead of women. Besides, the
result discussed above is also proved by the confidence interval for
depression among men with different number of children in the household,
with the confidence interval of the respondents having no children has
no overlap with that of the respondents having one or two children and
respondents having three or more children. Then, the association of
gender and race together with self-reported depression was studied. From
the barplot, it can be observed that the prevalence of past depression
is higher in women than men for all races included in the dataset, with
White females and White males having the highest prevalence of
depression among White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic people in specific.
The association of age and gender with depression was also examined
through a chi-square test and barplot, and the result is that for women,
the prevalence of self-reported past depression remains stable between
the age group 30-49 and 50-64, but decreases significantly for the age
group 65+. A confidence intervals plot was drawn for illustration, and
the gap in the magnitude of changes in the prevalence of self-reported
depression shows that age might affect depression differently among men
and women.</p>
<p>By examining how gender, race, age, and the number of children in
households affect the self-reported number of days of bad mental health
in the past 30 days and self-reported past depression, we found that all
the factors, to some extent, influence the self-reported number of days
of bad mental health in a similar way to depression. Accordingly, we
presume that this is because longer periods of bad mental health can
lead to depression. Correspondingly, people with depression are much
more likely to be in bad mental health for a longer period.</p>
<p>In addition to examining how gender, the number of children in
households, race, and age are associated with the two outcome variables
discussed above, we also studied the state-level distribution of the two
variables. We first looked at the top 10 states with the highest and
lowest estimated percentage of women and men who self-reported past
depression through bar plots. The plot below shows that West Virginia
has the highest estimated percentage of women who self-reported past
depression, followed by Kentucky, Utah, Tennessee, Indiana, Oregon,
Oklahoma, Louisiana, Vermont, and Arkansas. In detail, the estimated
percentage of self-reported depression among women is around 30% in all
these states, with very small differences in magnitude. Then,
visualizing the ten states with the lowest estimated percentages of
self-reported depression among women, we found that Hawaii has the
lowest estimates, followed by California, New York, New Jersey,
Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, Georgia, and Connecticut. Bar
plots for the ten states with the highest and lowest estimated
percentages of self-reported depression among men were drawn as well.
The results are that Vermont has the highest estimated percent of
self-reported depression, followed by West Virginia, Arkansas,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Louisiana, Oregon, Oklahoma, and
Washington, DC. In specific, the estimated percentage of self-reported
depression among men is around 20% in all these states, with very small
differences in magnitude. Additionally, compared with data for women,
all these states also have the highest estimated percent of
self-reported depression among women, except for Rhodes Island and
Washinton, DC, which might indicate a high disparity in mental health
outcomes in the remaining eight states. Regarding the states with the
lowest estimated percent of depression among men, Hawaii has the lowest
percent value, followed by South Dakota, Maryland, Delaware, Iowa,
Illinois, California, Nevada, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Again, the
difference in magnitude is small. Among these states, South Dakota,
Iowa, Nevada, Arizona, and Wisconsin were not among the top 10 states
that have the lowest estimated % of self-reported past depression among
women. This observation reiterates the possibility of a larger gender
gap in this mental health outcome in certain states. A grouped barplot
was then created for a generalized visualization of the data presented
above. The result shows that the prevalence among women is the highest
in West Virginia and lowest in Hawaii. Interestingly, this prevalence
among men did not show a decrease as obvious as that among women,
indicating that the gender difference in this outcome is larger in some
states than others. As a further investigation, another grouped barplot
of the prevalence of self-reported past diagnosis of depression by
gender in each US state was created, arranged in descending order by the
difference of the value of this estimate between men and women. The
graph shows that the ten states that have the largest difference in the
estimated % of self-reported past depression are, in order, Kentucky,
Indiana, Wisconsin, Utah, West Virginia, Montana, Oregon, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, and Tennessee. Among these ten states, Kentucky, Indiana,
Utah, West Virginia, Oregan, Oklahoma, and Tennessee are also in the top
10 states that have the highest estimated % of self-reported past
depression among women, suggesting these states not only have overall
high past depression prevalence but also high gender disparity in past
depression prevalence.</p>
<p>The same analysis procedures were repeated for the outcome variable,
the percent of respondents who self-reported more than 15 days of mental
health not good in the past 30 days. We can see that the top 10 states
with the highest estimated percentage of women who self-reported more
than 15 days of bad mental health in the past 30 days are in order, West
Virginia, Alabama, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana,
Utah, Nevada, and Ohio. According to the graph, the estimated
percentages of self-reported &gt;15 days where mental health is not good
among women are around 15% in all these states, with small differences
in magnitude. Next, based on the plot showing the ten states with the
lowest estimated percentage of women who self-reported &gt;15 days where
mental health was not good in the past 30 days, we found that the top 10
states with the lowest estimated percentage of women self-reported &gt;
15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days are in order, Hawaii,
South Dakota, Washington DC, Minnesota, Alaska, New York, North Dakota,
Nebraska, New Jersey, and Maryland. The differences in the magnitude of
this mental health outcome are small among these states. The
visualization for the ten states with the highest estimated percent of
self-reported &gt;15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days
among men shows that Arkansas has the highest estimated percent, with
Tennessee, West Virginia, Nevada, Kentucky, South Carolina, Alabama,
Vermont, Oklahoma, and Louisianna followed. Specifically, the estimated
percents of self-reported &gt;15 days mental health not good in the past
30 days among men are around 10% in all these states, which is close in
value to the ten lowest percents of this mental health outcome among
women, as we saw above. It is also worth noting that these states
overlap with the top 10 states where the most percent of women reporting
&gt;15 days of mental health not good in the past 30 days, except for
Rhodes Island and Washington DC. This indicates that the eight
overlapping states probably have the highest percentage of people
reporting more than half of the past 30 days mental health not good. The
generalized grouped barplot by gender of female shows that the
percentage among women is the highest in West Virginia and lowest in
Hawaii. Again, this percentage among men did not show a decrease as
obvious as that among women, showing that in states where women are
“happier” (indicated by fewer days mental health is not good in the past
month), men are not more likely to be “happier” as well. This finding
also suggests that the gender difference in this outcome is larger in
some states than others. The last barplot, with the prevalence of
self-reported &gt;15 days mental health not good grouped by gender in
each US state in descending order, shows that the ten states that have
the largest difference of the estimated percent of self-reported &gt;15
days mental health not good in the past 30 days are, in order, Oklahoma,
West Virginia, Alabama, Wyoming, Indiana, Utah, Iowa, Wisconsin,
Virginia, and Kentucky. Among these ten states, West Virginia, Alabama,
Kentucky, and Utah are also among the top 10 states where the highest
percent of women reported &gt;15 days of mental health not good in the
past 30 days. A table showing the top 10 states with the highest
prevalence of self-reported past depression among women, self-reported
&gt;15 days mental health not good among women, and the largest
difference in these two mental health outcomes by gender were presented

<h3>Regression Analysis</h3>
<p>Logistic regressions were employed to analyze how the exposures
(gender and the number of children in households) and demographic
covariates (race, age, marital status), socioeconomic covariates
(education, income, employment), and health-related covariates (general
health and exercise) are associated with the outcome variables,
self-reported past depression and self-reported number of days of bad
mental health in the past 30 days. The regression models were first
constructed for the outcome variables, self-reported past depression.
Examining the relationship between the outcome variable and exposures
(gender and the number of children in households) only, we found the
fitted logistic regression model to be ŷ = 0.171 + 1.968<em>female +
0.931</em>children (none or two) + 0.893<em>children (three or more).
Then, controlling for the demographic covariates (race, age, marital
status), we had the fitted regression model on top of the exposures to
be ŷ = 0.199 + 2.066</em>female + 0.871<em>children (none or two) +
0.846</em>children (three or more) + 0.534<em>race (Black) +
0.319</em>race (Asian) + 0.536<em>race (Hispanic) + 0.937</em>race
(Other) + 0.971<em>age (30 to 49) + 0.809</em>age (50 to 64) +
0.474<em>age (65+) + 1.695</em>marital status (not married). Moreover,
with both demographic covariates (race, age, marital status) and
socioeconomic covariates (education, income, employment) being
controlled, the resulting fitted regression model is ŷ = 0.262 +
2.036<em>female + 0.880</em>children (none or two) + 0.816<em>children
(three or more) + 0.460</em>race (Black) + 0.344<em>race (Asian) +
0.450</em>race (Hispanic) + 0.816<em>race (Other) + 0.963</em>age (30 to
49) + 0.721<em>age (50 to 64) + 0.434</em>age (65+) + 1.318<em>marital
status (not married) + 1.060</em>education (high school or some college)
+ 1.009<em>education (bachelors or higher) + 0.806</em>income (35,000 to
75,000) + 0.679<em>income (&gt; 75,000) + 1.152</em>employment
(homemaker/student/retired) + 2.531<em>employment (unemployed). Lastly,
by controlling for all the covariates above and the health-related
covariates (general health and exercise), we obtained the fitted
logistic regression model as is ŷ = 0.107 + 2.066</em>female +
0.892<em>children (none or two) + 0.850</em>children (three or more) +
0.443<em>race (Black) + 0.342</em>race (Asian) + 0.430<em>race
(Hispanic) + 0.787</em>race (Other) + 0.843<em>age (30 to 49) +
0.568</em>age (50 to 64) + 0.326<em>age (65+) + 1.307</em>marital status
(not married) + 1.198<em>education (high school or some college) +
1.238</em>education (bachelors or higher) + 0.879<em>income (35,000 to
75,000) + 0.805</em>income (&gt; 75,000) + 1.116<em>employment
(homemaker/student/retired) + 2.051</em>employment (unemployed) +
2.205<em>general health (very good/good) + 5.303</em>general health
(poor) + 1.141<em>exercise (no exercise). Since 4 different regression
models were generated, AIC test was conducted to select the “best”
fitted model. With AIC values being 396110.7, 370597.7, 280968.4, and
270506.8 for the model with exposures only, the model controlling for
demographic covariates, the model controlling for demographic and
socioeconomic covariates, and the model controlling for demographic
covariates, socioeconomic covariates, and health-related covariates,
respectively, we selected our final model to be the one with the
smallest AIC value, which is the full model with all three types of
covariates controlled, ŷ = 0.107 + 2.066</em>female + 0.892<em>children
(none or two) + 0.850</em>children (three or more) + 0.443<em>race
(Black) + 0.342</em>race (Asian) + 0.430<em>race (Hispanic) +
0.787</em>race (Other) + 0.843<em>age (30 to 49) + 0.568</em>age (50 to
64) + 0.326<em>age (65+) + 1.307</em>marital status (not married) +
1.198<em>education (high school or some college) + 1.238</em>education
(bachelors or higher) + 0.879<em>income (35,000 to 75,000) +
0.805</em>income (&gt; 75,000) + 1.116<em>employment
(homemaker/student/retired) + 2.051</em>employment (unemployed) +
2.205<em>general health (very good/good) + 5.303</em>general health
(poor) + 1.141*exercise (no exercise).</p>
<p>Additionally, we also examined the relationship between the number of
children in the household and self-reported depression diagnosis among
men and women. For male, we obtained the fitted regression model to be ŷ
= 0.093 + 0.838<em>children (none or two) + 0.785</em>children (three or
more) + 0.560<em>race (Black) + 0.381</em>race (Asian) + 0.513<em>race
(Hispanic) + 0.966</em>race (Other) + 0.942<em>age (30 to 49) +
0.588</em>age (50 to 64) + 0.368<em>age (65+) + 1.359</em>marital status
(not married) + 1.190<em>education (high school or some college) +
1.325</em>education (bachelors or higher) + 0.841<em>income (35,000 to
75,000) + 0.812</em>income (&gt; 75,000) + 1.317<em>employment
(homemaker/student/retired) + 2.364</em>employment (unemployed) +
2.046<em>general health (very good/good) + 4.783</em>general health
(poor) + 1.217<em>exercise (no exercise). For female, we had the fitted
regression model to be ŷ = 0.243 + 0.942</em>children (none or two) +
0.915<em>children (three or more) + 0.385</em>race (Black) +
0.319<em>race (Asian) + 0.382</em>race (Hispanic) + 0.674<em>race
(Other) + 0.778</em>age (30 to 49) + 0.548<em>age (50 to 64) +
0.301</em>age (65+) + 1.290<em>marital status (not married) +
1.187</em>education (high school or some college) + 1.156<em>education
(bachelors or higher) + 0.909</em>income (35,000 to 75,000) +
0.814<em>income (&gt; 75,000) + 1.015</em>employment
(homemaker/student/retired) + 1.827<em>employment (unemployed) +
2.324</em>general health (very good/good) + 5.708<em>general health
(poor) + 1.101</em>exercise (no exercise). Accordingly, based on the
regression models for men and women, it can be concluded that the number
of children influences women and men in different ways.</p>
