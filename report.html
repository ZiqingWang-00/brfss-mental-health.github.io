<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Current literature provide inconsistent evidence on gender difference
in mental health outcomes. According to WHO, “women are more likely to
be treated for depression than men even though the rates of depression
don’t differ greatly between the gender”. However, there are also
research studies suggesting that women are more likely than men to have
depression. To solve this confusion, the main goals of this project are
to 1) compare state-level differences in depression prevalence and
average number of days with unwell mental health between US adult men
and women and 2) examine factors that potentially affect mental health
outcomes. After finding out whether there indeed is a gender gap in
mental health outcomes, it may in turn supply evidence that help answer
other public health questions, such as whether women are overtreated for
mental health disorders.</p>
</div>
<div id="background-and-related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Background and related work</h2>
<p>As Leibenluft, E mentioned in his book <em>Gender differences in mood
and anxiety disorders: From bench to bedside.</em>, whether the
presentation and course of illness differ by gender remain unknown
because different researches give different results. And based on the
large amount of data given by CDC (<em>Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System Survey Data</em>), we believe we can answer this
question by means of data analysis. At the same time, ignoring these
differences (as it always has been) may cause danger to patients, stated
by Partner, Q in <em>Exploring gender bias in healthcare</em>. For men,
they are less likely to be treated partially because they resist
discussing their emotion with doctor due to gender stereotype. For
women, we also need to guarantee that they won’t be overtreated. These
related works show the importance of finding out the main effects for
depression of different genders. Also, noticing that the United States
is a country with great diversity among different states, we decided to
explore the circumstances at state-level.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are interested in how presence of children in the
household might affect women and men’s mental health differently. This
question was inspired by personal observations and experience - Women
are usually more likely to assume more care-giving responsibilities in
the household. Then is women’s mental health affected more than men’s by
the presence of children in the household?</p>
</div>
<div id="research-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Research questions</h2>
<div id="main-research-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Main research questions</h3>
<p>We are interested in the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How does the geological distribution of mental health outcomes
across US states differ among men and women?</p></li>
<li><p>Do men and women have different mental health outcomes, taking
into account of demographic, socioeconomic, and health factors?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the number of children in the household affect the mental
health of men and women differently?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="post-hoc-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Post-hoc questions</h3>
<p>While answering our main research questions, some additional
interesting questions emerged, and we tried answering some of them after
our main analyses. These “post-hoc” questions include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is state-level prevalence of mental health outcomes associated with
state-level gender inequality?<br />
</li>
<li>How do mental health care service utilization and opinions on mental
health disorders differ among men and women? How are these differences
associated with women and men’s mental health?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="method" class="section level2">
<h2>Method</h2>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>We uses multiple data sources for our project. For our main research
questions, we used the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) data downloaded from <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html">the CDC
website</a>. BRFSS is an annual, nationally representative
cross-sectional survey on non-institutionalized American adults’
health-related risk behaviors, health conditions, and health care
seeking behaviors. The BRFSS is a complex survey that involves
multistage clustering and stratification. In 2021, 438,693 Americans
were included in the BRFSS.</p>
<p>For our post-hoc explorations, we used the Women, Peace, and Security
(WPI) index published by Georgetown University. According to the <a
href="https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/">organization’s
website</a>, the WPS index draws from recognized data source to quantify
women’s inclusion, justice, and security. We used this index as a
measurement of state-level gender inequality. We also downloaded the US
states’ GDP per capita in 2021 from <a
href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/248063/per-capita-us-real-gross-domestic-product-gdp-by-state/">here</a>.
We also used the 2012 BRFSS data, which is the last (most recent) BRFSS
survey that contains questions on mental health service utilization and
questions related to attitudes and beliefs toward mental health care and
stigmatization. This data set was also downloaded from <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2012.html">the CDC
website</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="outcome-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Outcome variables</h3>
<p>We used two variables to measure mental health. The first variable is
the self-reportd past depression. The participants were asked if they
have ever been told that they had a depressive disorder (including
depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression). The
second variable is the self-reported number of days of bad mental health
in the past 30 days. The participants were asked: “Now thinking about
your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with
emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental
health not good?”.</p>
<p>For the first outcome variable, we dichotomized it into a binary
variable with two levels: “yes” and “no”. For the second outcome
variable, we recoded it into a binary variable with two levels: <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> 15 days mental health not good in
the past 30 days, and more than 15 days mental health not good in the
past 30 days.</p>
<p>We used the first outcome variable as a proxy to measure respondents’
chronic mental health status, since it asks for any occurrence of
depression, a common mental health disorder, across the respondent’s
life span. We used the second outcome variable as a proxy for measuring
respondents’ temporal mental health status, since it asks about recent
mental health status.</p>
</div>
<div id="exposures" class="section level3">
<h3>Exposures</h3>
<p>We are interested in two exposure variables. The first one is
respondent’s gender coded as female or male based on their answers to
whether they were male or female and whether they were male or female at
birth. The second exposure variable is the number of children in the
respondent’s household, which was recoded to three levels: none, one or
two, and three or more.</p>
</div>
<div id="covariates" class="section level3">
<h3>Covariates</h3>
<p>Demographic covariates in our analyses include race/ethnicity
(recoded as non-Hispanic white, black, Asian, Hispanic, and other), age
(recoded as 18-29 years old, 30-49 years old, 50-64 years old, and 65 or
older), employment status (recoded as employed for salary,
homemake/student/retired, and unemployed), and marital status (recoded
as married and not married). Socioeconomic cavariates include education
level (recoded as less than high school, high school or some college,
and Bachelors’s degree or higher) and annual income (recoded as <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> 35000 dollars, between 35000 and
75000 dollars, and more than 75000 dollars). Health-related covariates
include self-reported general health (recoded as excellent, very
good/good, and fair/poor) and any self-reported exercises in the past 30
days (recoded as yes and no).</p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
<p>National surveys such and BRFSS and NHIS are not simple random
samples because observations have different probabilities of being
sampled due to complex survey designs. Therefore, before analyzing
nationally representative survey data, we must apply survey weights, or
all our estimates will be invalid. Therefore, after identifying the
stratum and the BRFSS-assigned weights for each observation, we
converted the data set into a <strong>survey design object</strong>
using the srvyr package.</p>
<p>We computed the <strong>survey-weighted and unweighted summary
counts</strong> of exposure and covariate categories in each level of
the two mental health outcome variables. We used Chi-squared tests for
weighted survey data to identify differences in mental health outcomes
by gender as well as differences in mental health outcomes and other
variables (e.g., number of children in household, age, race/ethnicity)
by gender.</p>
<p>We used <strong>survey-weighted binary logistic regression</strong>
to examine the association between gender and past depression and &gt;15
days mental health not good in the past 30 days, respectively. We
started with a crude model that only included the exposures (gender and
the number of children in the household). Then we constructed a larger
model by adding demographic covariates, which are age, race/ethnicity,
and marital status. Then we constructed another model by adding
socioeconomic covariates to the previous model, which are education,
annual income, and employment status. Finally, we constructed our full
model by adding physical health related variables, which are
self-reported general health and self-reported any physical exercise in
the past 30 days. Survey weights were applied to all regression models
as well. The regression models were compared using the
<strong>AIC</strong> criterion. Models with the lowest AIC values were
selected as final models.</p>
<p>The final model for each of the two mental health outcomes were used
to compute the <strong>predictive marginal means</strong> for each
independent variable. According to the documentation of the survey
package, the predictive marginal mean for one level of a factor variable
is the probability-weighted average of the fitted values for the model
on new data where all observations are set to that specific level of the
factor variable but have whatever values of adjustment covariates they
really have. In our case where we have a binary logistic regression
model, the predictive marginal mean shows the effect of a categorical
variable on the predicted probability of the response variable,
adjusting for all other predictor variables included in the model. We
computed the predictive marginal means because we think it better
demonstrates the magnitude of a factor predictor’s effect on the outcome
variable than the odds, because odds are less intuitive than
probabilities. The final models were also used to calculate the
<strong>predicted probability</strong> of each mental health outcome
given each combination of levels of independent variables. We put these
results in a Shiny app so that users can play around with different
factor levels and observe how they affect mental health outcomes
according to our selected model.</p>
<p>To check whether the number of children in the household has
differential effect on mental health by gender, we <strong>subsetted the
data by gender</strong> (one data set only has men, the other only has
women) and ran the best logistic regression models selected from above
separately on the two subsetted data sets, excluding the gender
variable.</p>
<p>In addition, for each of the two mental health outcomes, we
<strong>tabulated the top 10 states</strong> with the best and worst
mental health outcomes among women and men, using the weighted
estimates. We visualized the <strong>geographic distributions</strong>
by plotting the state-level prevalence of self-reported depression and
the average number of days mental health not good in the past 30 days by
gender on the US map. After observing the geographic distribution of the
mental health outcomes, we became interested in whether different levels
of gender equality in each US state affects women’s mental health
outcomes.</p>
<p>To answer this question, we first fitted a simple <strong>linear
regression</strong> on the state-level prevalence of self-reported
depression and the state-level prevalence of &gt;15 days in the past 30
days mental health not good against the WPS index, respectively. For
each of the model we obtained, we then adjusted for the state-level
per-capita GDP.</p>
<p>Eventually, we became interested in the reasons behind the gender
differences in the mental health outcome variables in the main analyses.
We think that they might have to do with different levels of mental
health service utilization, public stigmatization, and personal beliefs
and attitudes. Using three variables we found in the 2012 BRFSS data
(any current usage of mental health medicine or service, perception of
public stigma against people with mental health illnesses, and belief in
the effectiveness of mental health treatment), we visualized how these
variables differ among men and women, incorporating survey weights. From
there, we noted some interesting observations and some potential next
steps.</p>

<h3>Explanatory Analysis</h3>
<div id="respondent-level-analysis-self-reported-past-depression"
class="section level4">
<h4>Respondent-level analysis: self-reported past depression</h4>
<p>We first verified that <strong>self-reported past depression is
associated with gender</strong> using the chi-square test (p <span
class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 0). We proceeded to testing the
effects of selected covariates (number of children in the household,
race/ethnicity, and age) on past depression by gender.</p>
<p>We found that the prevalence of self-reported past depression is
associated with the number of children in the household for men but not
women (p = 3.49e-12 and 0.663, respectively). More specifically, data
visualization shows that <strong>women who don’t have children and women
who have children in the household have about the same prevalence of
self-reported past depression. However, fewer percentages of men who
have children report past depression than men who don’t have children in
the household</strong>.</p>
<p>We also found that the prevalence of past depression is higher in
women than men for all race/ethnicities included. White people and
people who are not white, black, Asian, nor Hispanic have the highest
prevalence of past depression, while Asians report the lowest prevalence
of past depression.</p>
<p>As for the association between past depression and age among men and
women, we found that <strong>for both women and men, the prevalence of
self-reported past depression remains stable between the age group 30-49
and 50-64, but decreases significantly between 18-29 and 30-49 and
between 50-64 and 65+. However, the manitude of decrease is larger among
women than men</strong>. This suggests that age might affect mental
health differently among men and women.</p>

<h4>Respondent-level analysis: Recent frequency of bad mental
health</h4>
<p>We first examined whether the number of days mental health not good
in the past 30 days (<span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> 15 days
and &gt;15 days) is associated with the exposure, respondent’s gender
using a chi-square test. The resulting p-value of 1.014e-67 indicates
that <strong>the number of days of bad mental health in the past 30 days
is associated with gender in that more % of women reported &gt;15 days
of bad mental health in the past month</strong>. We then proceeded to
studying the relationship between the number of days of bad mental
health in the past 30 days and some of the other covariates, on top of
the effects of gender.</p>
<p>We first studied how the number of children in the household affected
the self-reported prevalence of over 15 days of bad mental health in the
past 30 days among men and women. Based on a bar plot, we found an
interesting result that <strong>men who have children in the household
have a significantly lower prevalence of self-reported over 15 days of
bad mental health while women who have children don’t</strong>, which
was verified by chi-square tests with p-values of 0.023 and 0.093 for
men and women, respectively. That is, the number of children in the
household is significantly associated with self-reported over 15 days of
bad mental health in the past 30 days among men but not women.</p>
<p>Next, we examined how gender and race/ethnicity together associated
with self-reported over 15 days of bad mental health in the past 30
days. We found that that <strong>the proportion of &gt;15 days of in the
past 30 days in bad mental health in women is higher than in men for all
race/ethnicities included</strong>. More specifically, White women have
the highest prevalence of self-reported recent bad mental health than
Black, Asian, and Hispanic women, and the same holds true for Black
Men.</p>
<p>As for age, we found that <strong>for women, the prevalence of
self-reported &gt;15 days of bad mental in the past 30 days only drops
slightly when entering the age group of 50-64, but decreases much more
when entering the age group of 30-49 and of 65+ (the same trend is among
men but in smaller magnitude)</strong>. This result might be an
indication of differential effect of aging on recent bad mental health
days among men and women).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that gender, race, age, and the number of children
in households all to some extent affect the self-reported number of days
of bad mental health in the past 30 days and self-reported past
depression similarly. We presume that this is because longer periods of
bad mental health can lead to depression, and conversely people with
depression are more likely to be in bad mental health for a longer
period.</p>
</div>
<div id="state-level-analysis" class="section level4">
<h4>State-level analysis</h4>
<p>In this set of analysis, we tabulated the top 10 states with the
highest and lowest estimated percentage of women and men who
self-reported past depression and who reported bad recent mental health
(&gt;15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days). More details
can be found <a
href="https://ziqingwang-00.github.io/brfss-mental-health.github.io/state_level_eda.html">here</a>.
State rankings are informative but difficult to picture. Therefore, we
created a dashboard (INSERT LINK) that allows the audience to explore
the geographic distribution of the two mental health outcomes by gender.
In summary, we found that <strong>Southern states and Northern states
(Northwest and Northeast) generally have worse mental health outcomes
both women and men, while Southern states and Midwest states generally
have the largest gender difference in mental health
outcomes</strong>.</p>

</div>
<div id="regression-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Regression Analysis</h3>
<p>For both outcomes, the full model had the smallest AIC value.
Therefore, we selected the full models as our final model. Overall, we
found that after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and physical
health factors, women are still more likely to report depression and
&gt;15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days compared to men.
However, there is no significant association between the number of
children in the household and any of the two mental health outcomes,
after adjusting for other covariates.<br />
In our subsetted analysis, we found that the number of children in the
household affects men and women’s mental health outcomes differently.
Among men, having children (one or two, or three or more) in the
household is significantly associated with lower odds of reporting past
depression. However, among women, having children in the household is
not significantly associated with the odds of reporting depression.</p>
<p>Also, among men, having children in the household is not
significantly associated with the odds of self-reported &gt;15 days
mental health not good in the past 30 days. However, for women, having
one or two children in the household (but not three or more) is
significantly associated with lower odds of reporting &gt;15 days mental
health not good in the past 30 days.</p>
<p>In summary, based on the subsetted analysis, it seems like having
children in the household influences women and men’s mental health
differently. More specifically, if we view self-reported past depression
as a proxy measurement of chronic/long-term mental health and view
self-reported &gt;15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days as
a proxy measurement of recent distress, we can conjecture that one or
more children in the household is beneficial to men’s chronic mental
health but not women’s, and that one or two children in the household is
beneficial for women’s recent mental health but not men’s. The details
of the models and the numbers for self-reported depression and
self-reported recent days of bad mental health are <a

<div id="state-level-mental-health-outcomes-and-gender-inequality"
class="section level4">
<h4>State-level mental health outcomes and gender inequality</h4>
<p>We found that the WPS index is negatively associated with the
prevalence of self-reported depression and the average number of days
mental health not good in the past 30 days, before and after adjusting
per-capita GDP. This indicates that the higher women’s status in the
state, the lower the state-level prevalence of self-reported depression
and &gt;15 days mental health not good recently among women. Details and

<div id="beliefs-attitudes-and-service-utilization"
class="section level4">
<h4>Beliefs, attitudes, and service utilization</h4>
<p>We found that among those who reported past depression or &gt;15 days
mental health not good in the past 30 days, women are more likely to use
mental health services than men. This might explain why women report
worse mental health outcomes than men. For example, people who seek
professional help are more likely to be told that they have depression
than those who don’t. We also found that men perceive less public stigma
against people with mental health illnesses compared to women, and that
both men and women are highly likely to agree that mental health
treatments are effective. The numbers and details can be found <a

<p>The post-hoc analyses described before point in some potential
directions for the next steps. For example, from the negative
association between gender equality and prevalence of self-reported
depression and recent bad mentaal health among women, we can further
ask: How do specific policies impact women’s mental health on a state
level? For example, different abortion policies across states?</p>
