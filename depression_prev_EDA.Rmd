### Summary statistics

Below is the unweighted counts of the all included demographic variables, exposure, and other covariates, dichotomized by whether they self-reported whether they've ever been told by a physician that they had depression.  

```{r}
tb1_unweighted_depr =
  brfss_design$variables %>%
  tbl_summary(by = depression, percent = "row", 
              include = c(sex, race, age, marital_status,
                             children,
                             education, income, employment,
                             general_health, exercise),
              type = list(exercise ~ "categorical"))

tb1_unweighted_depr
```

Below is the weighted summary counts:
```{r}
tb1_weighted_depr =
  brfss_design %>%
  tbl_svysummary(by = depression, percent = "row", 
                 include = c(sex, race, age, marital_status,
                             children,
                             education, income, employment,
                             general_health, exercise),
                  type = list(exercise ~ "categorical"))

tb1_weighted_depr
```

### Gender, number of children in family, and depression

```{r}
brfss_design %>%
  group_by(sex, children, depression) %>%
  summarize(depression_prev = 100*survey_mean(na.rm = T, vartype = c("ci"))) %>%
  filter(!is.na(children), depression == "yes") %>%
  select(-depression) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = children, y = depression_prev, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=depression_prev_low, ymax=depression_prev_upp), 
                width=.2, position=position_dodge(.9))

```

Men who have children in the household have significantly lower prevalence of self-reported depression while women who have children don't.
