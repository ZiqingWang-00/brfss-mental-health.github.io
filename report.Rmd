## Introduction
Current literature provide inconsistent evidence on gender difference in mental health outcomes. According to WHO, “women are more likely to be treated for depression than men even though the rates of depression don’t differ greatly between the gender”. However, there are also research studies suggesting that women are more likely than men to have depression. To solve this confusion, the main goals of this project are to 1) compare state-level differences in depression prevalence and average number of days with unwell mental health between US adult men and women and 2) examine factors that potentially affect mental health outcomes. After finding out whether there indeed is a gender gap in mental health outcomes, it may in turn supply evidence that help answer other public health questions, such as whether women are overtreated for mental health disorders. 

## Background and related work
As Leibenluft, E mentioned in his book *Gender differences in mood and anxiety disorders: From bench to bedside.*, whether the presentation and course of illness differ by gender remain unknown because different researches give different results. And based on the large amount of data given by CDC (*Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data*), we believe we can answer this question by means of data analysis. At the same time, ignoring these differences (as it always has been) may cause danger to patients, stated by Partner, Q in *Exploring gender bias in healthcare*. For men, they are less likely to be treated partially because they resist discussing their emotion with doctor due to gender stereotype. For women, we also need to guarantee that they won't be overtreated. These related works show the importance of finding out the main effects for depression of different genders. Also, noticing that the United States is a country with great diversity among different states, we decided to explore the circumstances at state-level.  

Additionally, we are interested in how presence of children in the household might affect women and men's mental health differently. This question was inspired by personal observations and experience - Women are usually more likely to assume more care-giving responsibilities in the household. Then is women's mental health affected more than men's by the presence of children in the household? 

## Research questions
### Main research questions
We are interested in the following questions:

* How does the geological distribution of mental health outcomes across US states differ among men and women?

* Do men and women have different mental health outcomes, taking into account of demographic, socioeconomic, and health factors?

* Does the number of children in the household affect the mental health of men and women differently?

### Post-hoc questions
While answering our main research questions, some additional interesting questions emerged, and we tried answering some of them after our main analyses. These "post-hoc" questions include the following:  

* Is state-level prevalence of mental health outcomes associated with state-level gender inequality?  
* How do mental health care service utilization and opinions on mental health disorders differ among men and women? How are these differences associated with women and men's mental health?

## Method

### Data
We uses multiple data sources for our project. For our main research questions, we used the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data downloaded from [the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html). BRFSS is an annual, nationally representative cross-sectional survey on non-institutionalized American adults' health-related risk behaviors, health conditions, and health care seeking behaviors. The BRFSS is a complex survey that involves multistage clustering and stratification. In 2021, 438,693 Americans were included in the BRFSS.  

For our post-hoc explorations, we used the Women, Peace, and Security (WPI) index published by Georgetown University. According to the [organization's website](https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/), the WPS index draws from recognized data source to quantify women’s inclusion, justice, and security. We used this index as a measurement of state-level gender inequality. We also downloaded the US states' GDP per capita in 2021 from [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/248063/per-capita-us-real-gross-domestic-product-gdp-by-state/). We also used the 2012 BRFSS data, which is the last (most recent) BRFSS survey that contains questions on mental health service utilization and questions related to attitudes and beliefs toward mental health care and stigmatization. This data set was also downloaded from [the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2012.html). 

### Outcome variables
We used two variables to measure mental health. The first variable is the self-reportd past depression. The participants were asked if they have ever been told that they had a depressive disorder (including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression). The second variable is the self-reported number of days of bad mental health in the past 30 days. The participants were asked: "Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?".  

For the first outcome variable, we dichotomized it into a binary variable with two levels: "yes" and "no". For the second outcome variable, we recoded it into a binary variable with two levels: $\leq$ 15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days, and more than 15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days.  

We used the first outcome variable as a proxy to measure respondents' chronic mental health status, since it asks for any occurrence of depression, a common mental health disorder, across the respondent's life span. We used the second outcome variable as a proxy for measuring respondents' temporal mental health status, since it asks about recent mental health status.   

### Exposures
We are interested in two exposure variables. The first one is respondent's gender coded as female or male based on their answers to whether they were male or female and whether they were male or female at birth. The second exposure variable is the number of children in the respondent's household, which was recoded to three levels: none, one or two, and three or more.

### Covariates
Demographic covariates in our analyses include race/ethnicity (recoded as non-Hispanic white, black, Asian, Hispanic, and other), age (recoded as 18-29 years old, 30-49 years old, 50-64 years old, and 65 or older), employment status (recoded as employed for salary, homemake/student/retired, and unemployed), and marital status (recoded as married and not married). Socioeconomic cavariates include education level (recoded as less than high school, high school or some college, and Bachelors's degree or higher) and annual income (recoded as $\leq$ 35000 dollars, between 35000 and 75000 dollars, and more than 75000 dollars). Health-related covariates include self-reported general health (recoded as excellent, very good/good, and fair/poor) and any self-reported exercises in the past 30 days (recoded as yes and no).

### Statistical Analysis
National surveys such and BRFSS and NHIS are not simple random samples because observations have different probabilities of being sampled due to complex survey designs. Therefore, before analyzing nationally representative survey data, we must apply survey weights, or all our estimates will be invalid. Therefore, after identifying the stratum and the BRFSS-assigned weights for each observation, we converted the data set into a **survey design object** using the srvyr package. 

We computed the **survey-weighted and unweighted summary counts** of exposure and covariate categories in each level of the two mental health outcome variables. We used Chi-squared tests for weighted survey data to identify differences in mental health outcomes by gender as well as differences in mental health outcomes and other variables (e.g., number of children in household, age, race/ethnicity) by gender.  

We used **survey-weighted binary logistic regression** to examine the association between gender and past depression and >15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days, respectively. We started with a crude model that only included the exposures (gender and the number of children in the household). Then we constructed a larger model by adding demographic covariates, which are age, race/ethnicity, and marital status. Then we constructed another model by adding socioeconomic covariates to the previous model, which are education, annual income, and employment status. Finally, we constructed our full model by adding physical health related variables, which are self-reported general health and self-reported any physical exercise in the past 30 days. Survey weights were applied to all regression models as well. The regression models were compared using the **AIC** criterion. Models with the lowest AIC values were selected as final models.  

The final model for each of the two mental health outcomes were used to compute the **predictive marginal means** for each independent variable. According to the documentation of the survey package, the predictive marginal mean for one level of a factor variable is the probability-weighted average of the fitted values for the model on new data where all observations are set to that specific level of the factor variable but have whatever values of adjustment covariates they really have. In our case where we have a binary logistic regression model, the predictive marginal mean shows the effect of a categorical variable on the predicted probability of the response variable, adjusting for all other predictor variables included in the model. We computed the predictive marginal means because we think it better demonstrates the magnitude of a factor predictor's effect on the outcome variable than the odds, because odds are less intuitive than probabilities. The final models were also used to calculate the **predicted probability** of each mental health outcome given each combination of levels of independent variables. We put these results in a Shiny app so that users can play around with different factor levels and observe how they affect mental health outcomes according to our selected model.  

To check whether the number of children in the household has differential effect on mental health by gender, we **subsetted the data by gender** (one data set only has men, the other only has women) and ran the best logistic regression models selected from above separately on the two subsetted data sets, excluding the gender variable.  

In addition, for each of the two mental health outcomes, we **tabulated the top 10 states** with the best and worst mental health outcomes among women and men, using the weighted estimates. We visualized the **geographic distributions** by plotting the state-level prevalence of self-reported depression and the average number of days mental health not good in the past 30 days by gender on the US map. After observing the geographic distribution of the mental health outcomes, we became interested in whether different levels of gender equality in each US state affects women's mental health outcomes.  

To answer this question, we first fitted a simple **linear regression** on the state-level prevalence of self-reported depression and the state-level prevalence of >15 days in the past 30 days mental health not good against the WPS index, respectively. For each of the model we obtained, we then adjusted for the state-level per-capita GDP.  

Eventually, we became interested in the reasons behind the gender differences in the mental health outcome variables in the main analyses. We think that they might have to do with different levels of mental health service utilization, public stigmatization, and personal beliefs and attitudes. Using three variables we found in the 2012 BRFSS data (any current usage of mental health medicine or service, perception of public stigma against people with mental health illnesses, and belief in the effectiveness of mental health treatment), we visualized how these variables differ among men and women, incorporating survey weights. From there, we noted some interesting observations and some potential next steps.


## Results

### Explanatory Analysis
#### Respondent-level analysis: self-reported past depression
We first verified that **self-reported past depression is associated with gender** using the chi-square test (p $\approx$ 0). We proceeded to testing the effects of selected covariates (number of children in the household, race/ethnicity, and age) on past depression by gender.  

We found that the prevalence of self-reported past depression is associated with the number of children in the household for men but not women (p = 3.49e-12 and 0.663, respectively). More specifically, data visualization shows that **women who don't have children and women who have children in the household have about the same prevalence of self-reported past depression. However, fewer percentages of men who have children report past depression than men who don't have children in the household**.  

We also found that the prevalence of past depression is higher in women than men for all race/ethnicities included. White people and people who are not white, black, Asian, nor Hispanic have the highest prevalence of past depression, while Asians report the lowest prevalence of past depression.  

As for the association between past depression and age among men and women, we found that **for both women and men, the prevalence of self-reported past depression remains stable between the age group 30-49 and 50-64, but decreases significantly between 18-29 and 30-49 and between 50-64 and 65+. However, the manitude of decrease is larger among women than men**. This suggests that age might affect mental health differently among men and women.  
Further details can be found [here](https://ziqingwang-00.github.io/brfss-mental-health.github.io/depression_prev_EDA.html).

#### Respondent-level analysis: Recent frequency of bad mental health days
We first examined whether the number of days mental health not good in the past 30 days ($\leq$ 15 days and >15 days) is associated with the exposure, respondent's gender using a chi-square test. The resulting p-value of 1.014e-67 indicates that **the number of days of bad mental health in the past 30 days is associated with gender in that more % of women reported >15 days of bad mental health in the past month**. We then proceeded to studying the relationship between the number of days of bad mental health in the past 30 days and some of the other covariates, on top of the effects of gender.  

We first studied how the number of children in the household affected the self-reported prevalence of over 15 days of bad mental health in the past 30 days among men and women. Based on a bar plot, we found an interesting result that **men who have children in the household have a significantly lower prevalence of self-reported over 15 days of bad mental health while women who have children don't**, which was verified by chi-square tests with p-values of 0.023 and 0.093 for men and women, respectively. That is, the number of children in the household is significantly associated with self-reported over 15 days of bad mental health in the past 30 days among men but not women.  

Next, we examined how gender and race/ethnicity together associated with self-reported over 15 days of bad mental health in the past 30 days. We found that that **the proportion of >15 days of in the past 30 days in bad mental health in women is higher than in men for all race/ethnicities included**. More specifically, White women have the highest prevalence of self-reported recent bad mental health than Black, Asian, and Hispanic women, and the same holds true for Black Men.  

As for age, we found that **for women, the prevalence of self-reported >15 days of bad mental in the past 30 days only drops slightly when entering the age group of 50-64, but decreases much more when entering the age group of 30-49 and of 65+ (the same trend is among men but in smaller magnitude)**. This result might be an indication of differential effect of aging on recent bad mental health days among men and women).  

It is worth noting that gender, race, age, and the number of children in households all to some extent affect the self-reported number of days of bad mental health in the past 30 days and self-reported past depression similarly. We presume that this is because longer periods of bad mental health can lead to depression, and conversely people with depression are more likely to be in bad mental health for a longer period.

#### State-level analysis
In this set of analysis, we tabulated the top 10 states with the highest and lowest estimated percentage of women and men who self-reported past depression and who reported bad recent mental health (>15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days). More details can be found [here](https://ziqingwang-00.github.io/brfss-mental-health.github.io/state_level_eda.html). State rankings are informative but difficult to picture. Therefore, we created a [dashboard](https://ziqingwang-00.github.io/brfss-mental-health.github.io/state_level_dashboard.html) that allows the audience to explore the geographic distribution of the two mental health outcomes by gender. In summary, we found that **Southern states and Northern states (Northwest and Northeast) generally have worse mental health outcomes both women and men, while Southern states and Midwest states generally have the largest gender difference in mental health outcomes**. 

### Regression Analysis
For both outcomes, the full model had the smallest AIC value. Therefore, we selected the full models as our final model. Overall, we found that **after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and physical health factors, women are still more likely to report depression and >15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days compared to men**. However, there is **no significant association between the number of children in the household and any of the two mental health outcomes, after adjusting for other covariates** in the full sample.  

**In our subsetted analysis, we found that the number of children in the household affects men and women's mental health outcomes differently**. Among men, having children (one or two, or three or more) in the household is significantly associated with lower odds of reporting past depression. However, among women, having children in the household is not significantly associated with the odds of reporting depression.  

Also, among men, having children in the household is not significantly associated with the odds of self-reported >15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days. However, for women, having one or two children in the household (but not three or more) is significantly associated with lower odds of reporting >15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days.  

In summary, based on the subsetted analysis, it seems like having children in the household influences women and men's mental health differently. More specifically, if we view self-reported past depression as a proxy measurement of chronic/long-term mental health and view self-reported >15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days as a proxy measurement of recent distress, we can conjecture that one or more children in the household is beneficial to men's chronic mental health but not women's, and that one or two children in the household is beneficial for women's recent mental health but not men's. The details of the models and the numbers for self-reported depression and self-reported recent days of bad mental health are [here](https://ziqingwang-00.github.io/brfss-mental-health.github.io/regression_depr.html) and [here](https://ziqingwang-00.github.io/brfss-mental-health.github.io/regression_mh_days.html), respectively. 

### Post-hoc explorations
#### State-level mental health outcomes and gender inequality
We found that **the WPS index is negatively associated with the prevalence of self-reported depression and >15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days, before and after adjusting per-capita GDP**. This indicates that the higher women's status in the state, the lower the state-level prevalence of self-reported depression and >15 days mental health not good recently among women. Details and numbers are [here](https://ziqingwang-00.github.io/brfss-mental-health.github.io/ecological.html).

#### Beliefs, attitudes, and service utilization
We found that **among those who reported past depression or >15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days, women are more likely to use mental health services than men**. This might explain why women report worse mental health outcomes than men. For example, people who seek professional help are more likely to be told that they have depression than those who don't. We also found that **men perceive less public stigma against people with mental health illnesses compared to women**, and that **both men and women are highly likely to agree that mental health treatments are effective**. The numbers and details can be found [here](https://ziqingwang-00.github.io/brfss-mental-health.github.io/mh_opinions_by_gender.html).  

## Discussion
### Takeaways 
We summarize some main takeaways in the project. 

* Men have better outcomes in both of the self-reported mental health measures (depression and number of bad mental health days in the past 30 days), before and after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and physical health-related covariates. 
* The association between mental health and childcare (measured by the number of children in the household) is different among women and men. Having children in the household is associated with lower odds of reporting depression among men but not women. Having one or two children in the household is associated with lower odds of reporting >15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days among women but not among men. The reasons behind the differential associations are unknown.
* Women living in states in the South and the Northwest generally have worse self-reported mental health outcomes. The gender difference in mental health outcomes are generally the largest in the South and the Midwest. 
* Women's mental health outcomes on a state-level is associated with gender inequality. 
* Women who reported past depression or >15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days are more likely to use mental health services than men who reported the same, despite that the majority in both women and men agree that mental health treatment are effective. Also, women had more pessimistic perception of public stigma against people with mental health illnesses than men.  

In summary, our project findings collectively suggests that there may be gender disparity in mental health, and such disparity is associated with childcare. Also, there also exists state-level gender disparity in mental health. The reasons behind these disparities are unclear, but some potential influential factors to zoom in include mental health service utilization, beliefs and attitudes toward mental health disorders, perception of other people's beliefs and attitudes toward mental health disorders, and state-level gender inequality.

### Limitations
One limitation is that we do not know how well self-reported past depression and self-reported mental health days estimate the true past depression and mental health days. For example, the self-reported measure might suffer social desirability bias. Another limitations is that all our conclusions are associational, not causal. Finally, the BRFSS data does not include institutionalized people, such as homeless people and prisoners. But these people are more vulnerable than the general population. More data collection and research should be directed into these vulnerable groups of people.

### Challenges
At the initial stages of the project, we had trouble importing the BRFSS data and pushing it to GitHub because of its format and its size, as the raw data is an XPT file about 1GB. Fortunately, we were able to import it using the Haven package and update our repo on GitHub by putting the large files in the gitignore document.  

Another major challenge is to learn about the survey package and the srvyr package. As mentioned before, all analyses of BRFSS require incorporation of survey weights. Therefore, we spent a lot of time reading the documentations of these packages to make sure the survey was weighted proporly.  

The biggest challenge is to make the Shiny app. The challenge was multi-fold: First, none of us had any experience with Shiny before, so it took a lot of effort to understand how Shiny app works and more effort to write one. Therefore, we spent a lot of time debugging. We also spent a lot of time optimizing the app's performance. In the first version of the Shiny app, we attempted to create a weighted logistic regression model and use it to compute the predictive marginal means and the predicted probabilities each time the user changes the inputs. However, this process takes more than 50 seconds for each input change, which would make the app unusable. We got around this issue by computing the predictive marginal means and the predicted probabilities for all possible combinations of user input separately in another file using loops and the map function. We were able to save the outputs as R objects and import it into the Shiny app. In this way, we just need to access the data based on user input, which made the Shiny app very fast to return the results.

### Next steps
The post-hoc analyses described before point in some potential directions for the next steps. For example, from the negative association between gender equality and prevalence of self-reported depression and recent bad mental health among women, we can further ask: How do specific policies impact women's mental health on a state level? For example, different abortion policies across states?  

Another next step is to find the effect of belief, attitude, and behavior factors on self-reported mental health outcomes. Understanding the reasons behind the gender differences in self-reported mental health outcomes help ensure the disparity truly exists and informs public health actions to target vulnerable groups.  

Another next step is to look deeper into differential impacts of caregiving in general on women and men's mental health. In this project, we only looked at children. However, care giving spans spouses and the elderlies in the household as well.  

Moreover, it might be interesting to look into some of the patterns we found in the exploratory data analysis - For example, why do Asians have the lowest prevalence of reporting past depression and >15 days mental health not good in the past days, while white people and people of race/ethnicities that are not white, black, Asian, nor Hispanic have the highest prevalence?
