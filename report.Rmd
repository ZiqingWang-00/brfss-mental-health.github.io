## Introduction
Current literature provide inconsistent evidence on gender difference in mental health outcomes. According to WHO, “women are more likely to be treated for depression than men even though the rates of depression don’t differ greatly between the gender”. However, there are also research studies suggesting that women are more likely than men to have depression. To solve this confusion, the main goals of this project are to 1) compare state-level differences in depression prevalence and average number of days with unwell mental health between US adult men and women and 2) examine factors that potentially affect mental health outcomes. After finding out whether there indeed is a gender gap in mental health outcomes, it may in turn supply evidence that help answer other public health questions, such as whether women are overtreated for mental health disorders. 

### Background and related work
As Leibenluft, E mentioned in his book *Gender differences in mood and anxiety disorders: From bench to bedside.*, whether the presentation and course of illness differ by gender remain unknown because of different researches give different results. And based on the large amount of data given by CDC (*Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data*), we believe we can answer this question by means of data analysis. At the same time, ignoring these differences (as it always has been) may cause danger to patients, stated by Partner, Q in *Exploring gender bias in healthcare*. For men, they are less likely to be treated partially because they resist discussing their emotion with doctor due to gender stereotype. For women, we also need to guarantee that they won't be overtreated. These related works show the importance of finding out the main effects for depression of different genders. Also, noticing that the United States is a country with great diversity among different states, we decided to explore the circumstances at state-level. 

### Research questions
We are interested in the following questions:

* How does the geological distribution of mental health outcomes across US states differ among men and women?

* Do men and women have different mental health outcomes, taking into account of demographic, socioeconomic, and health factors?

* Does the number of children in the household affect the mental health of men and women differently?

## Method

### Data
We used the 2021 BRFSS data downloaded from the CDC website. [INSERT introduction of the dataset]

### Outcome variables
We use two variables to measure mental health. The first variable is the self-reportd past diagnosis of depression. The participants were asked if they have everbeen told that they had a depressive disorder (including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression). The second variable is the self-reported number of days of bad mental health in the past 30 days. The participants were asked: "Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?". 

For the first outcome variable, we dichotomized it into a binary variable with "yes" and "no" levels (depression). For the second outcome variable, we recoded it into a categorical variable with three levels: none, between 1 and 15 days, and more than 15 days.  

### Exposure
We are interested in two exposure variables. The first one is the sex of participant coded as female or male based on their answers to whether they were male or female and whether they were male or female at birth. The second one is the number of children in the household, where participants were asked how many children there were in their household. 

### Covariates
Demographic covariates in our analyses include race/ethnicity, age, employment status, and marital status. Socioeconomic cavariates include education level and annual income. Health-related covariates include self-reported general health and any self-reported exercises in the past 30 days.

### Statistical Analysis
We computed weighted and unweighted summary counts of exposure and covariate categories in each level of the mental health outcome variables. 

We used the binary logistic regression model to examine the association between gender and the self-reported past diagnosis of depression and the dichotomized number of days of self-reported bad mental health in the past 30 days, respectively. 

For both outcome variables, we added demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related variables sequentially in the regression model and used cross validation to select the best model, respectively.

We subsetted the data by gender and ran the best logistic regression models selected from above separately on these two subsetted data sets. The aim of the subsetted analysis is to check whether the number of children in the household differentially impacts the two mental health outcomes.
