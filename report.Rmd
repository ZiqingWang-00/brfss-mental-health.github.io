## Introduction
Current literature provide inconsistent evidence on gender difference in mental health outcomes. According to WHO, “women are more likely to be treated for depression than men even though the rates of depression don’t differ greatly between the gender”. However, there are also research studies suggesting that women are more likely than men to have depression. To solve this confusion, the main goals of this project are to 1) compare state-level differences in depression prevalence and average number of days with unwell mental health between US adult men and women and 2) examine factors that potentially affect mental health outcomes. After finding out whether there indeed is a gender gap in mental health outcomes, it may in turn supply evidence that help answer other public health questions, such as whether women are overtreated for mental health disorders. 

## Background and related work
As Leibenluft, E mentioned in his book *Gender differences in mood and anxiety disorders: From bench to bedside.*, whether the presentation and course of illness differ by gender remain unknown because of different researches give different results. And based on the large amount of data given by CDC (*Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data*), we believe we can answer this question by means of data analysis. At the same time, ignoring these differences (as it always has been) may cause danger to patients, stated by Partner, Q in *Exploring gender bias in healthcare*. For men, they are less likely to be treated partially because they resist discussing their emotion with doctor due to gender stereotype. For women, we also need to guarantee that they won't be overtreated. These related works show the importance of finding out the main effects for depression of different genders. Also, noticing that the United States is a country with great diversity among different states, we decided to explore the circumstances at state-level.  

Additionally, we are interested in how presence of children in the household might affect women and men's mental health differently. This question was inspired by personal observations and experience - Women are usually more likely to assume more care-giving responsibilities in the household. Then is women's mental health affected more than men's by the presence of children in the household? 

## Research questions
### Main research questions
We are interested in the following questions:

* How does the geological distribution of mental health outcomes across US states differ among men and women?

* Do men and women have different mental health outcomes, taking into account of demographic, socioeconomic, and health factors?

* Does the number of children in the household affect the mental health of men and women differently?

### Post-hoc questions
While answering our main research questions, some additional interesting questions emerged, and we tried answering some of them after our main analyses. These "post-hoc" questions include the following:  

* Is state-level prevalence of mental health outcomes associated with state-level gender inequality?  
* How do mental health care service utilization and opinions on mental health disorders differ among men and women? How are these differences associated with women and men's mental health?

## Method

### Data
We uses multiple data sources for our project. For our main research questions, we used the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data downloaded from [the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html). BRFSS is an annual, nationally representative cross-sectional survey on non-institutionalized American adults' health-related risk behaviors, health conditions, and health care seeking behaviors. The BRFSS is a complex survey that involves multistage clustering and stratification. In 2021, 438,693 Americans were included in the BRFSS.  

For our post-hoc explorations, we used the Women, Peace, and Security (WPI) index published by Georgetown University. According to the [organization's website](https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/), the WPS index draws from recognized data source to quantify women’s inclusion, justice, and security. We used this index as a measurement of state-level gender inequality. We also downloaded the US states' GDP per capita in 2021 from [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/248063/per-capita-us-real-gross-domestic-product-gdp-by-state/). We also used the 2012 BRFSS data, which is the last (most recent) BRFSS survey that contains questions on mental health service utilization and questions related to attitudes and beliefs toward mental health care and stigmatization. This data set was also downloaded from [the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2012.html). 

### Outcome variables
We used two variables to measure mental health. The first variable is the self-reportd past depression. The participants were asked if they have ever been told that they had a depressive disorder (including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression). The second variable is the self-reported number of days of bad mental health in the past 30 days. The participants were asked: "Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?".  

For the first outcome variable, we dichotomized it into a binary variable with two levels: "yes" and "no". For the second outcome variable, we recoded it into a binary variable with two levels: $\leq$ 15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days, and more than 15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days.  

We used the first outcome variable as a proxy to measure respondents' chronic mental health status, since it asks for any occurrence of depression, a common mental health disorder, across the respondent's life span. We used the second outcome variable as a proxy for measuring respondents' temporal mental health status, since it asks about recent mental health status.   

### Exposures
We are interested in two exposure variables. The first one is respondent's gender coded as female or male based on their answers to whether they were male or female and whether they were male or female at birth. The second exposure variable is the number of children in the respondent's household, which was recoded to three levels: none, one or two, and three or more.

### Covariates
Demographic covariates in our analyses include race/ethnicity (recoded as non-Hispanic white, black, Asian, Hispanic, and other), age (recoded as 18-29 years old, 30-49 years old, 50-64 years old, and 65 or older), employment status (recoded as employed for salary, homemake/student/retired, and unemployed), and marital status (recoded as married and not married). Socioeconomic cavariates include education level (recoded as less than high school, high school or some college, and Bachelors's degree or higher) and annual income (recoded as $\leq$ 35000 dollars, between 35000 and 75000 dollars, and more than 75000 dollars). Health-related covariates include self-reported general health (recoded as excellent, very good/good, and fair/poor) and any self-reported exercises in the past 30 days (recoded as yes and no).

### Statistical Analysis
National surveys such and BRFSS and NHIS are not simple random samples because observations have different probabilities of being sampled due to complex survey designs. Therefore, before analyzing nationally representative survey data, we must apply survey weights, or all our estimates will be invalid. In our project, after selecting, cleaning, and recoding the variables, we converted the data set into a survey design object using the srvyr package. 

We computed weighted and unweighted summary counts of exposure and covariate categories in each level of the two mental health outcome variables. We used Chi-squared tests for weighted survey data to identify differences in mental health outcomes by gender as well as differences in mental health outcomes and other variables (e.g., number of children in household, age, race/ethnicity) by gender.  

We used binary logistic regression to examine the association between gender and past depression and >15 days mental health not good in the past 30 days, respectively. We started with a crude model that only included the exposures (gender and the number of children in the household). Then we constructed a larger model by adding demographic covariates, which are age, race/ethnicity, and marital status. Then we constructed another model by adding socioeconomic covariates to the previous model, which are education, annual income, and employment status. Finally, we constructed our full model by adding physical health related variables, which are self-reported general health and self-reported any physical exercise in the past 30 days. Survey weights were applied to all regression models as well. The regression models were compared using the AIC criterion. Models with the lowest AIC values were selected as final models.  

The final model for each of the two mental health outcomes were used to compute the predictive marginal means for each independent variable. According to the documentation of the survey package, the predictive marginal mean for one level of a factor variable is the probability-weighted average of the fitted values for the model on new data where all observations are set to that specific level of the factor variable but have whatever values of adjustment covariates they really have. In our case where we have a binary logistic regression model, the predictive marginal mean shows the effect of a categorical variable on the predicted probability of the response variable, adjusting for all other predictor variables included in the model. We computed the predictive marginal means because we think it better demonstrates the magnitude of a factor predictor's effect on the outcome variable than the odds, because odds are less intuitive than probabilities. The final models were also used to calculate the predicted probability of each mental health outcome given each combination of levels of independent variables. We put these results in a Shiny app so that users can play around with different factor levels and observe how they affect mental health outcomes according to our selected model.  

To check whether the number of children in the household has differential effect on mental health by gender, we subsetted the data by gender (one data set only has men, the other only has women) and ran the best logistic regression models selected from above separately on the two subsetted data sets, excluding the gender variable.
